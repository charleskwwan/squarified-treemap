Label Info Box:
Typically, squarified treemaps are used to visualize file trees, where nonleaf
nodes represent folders/directories, and leaf nodes are files. Furthermore, the
weight of a node represents the size of the folder/file. As such, a useful UI
component would be too see exactly what file a cell/rectangle on the treemap
represents and its size. Therefore, we implemented an info box that displays the
id and weight of the rectangle the mouse is hovering over.

Ancestor highlighting:
Although framing can demonstrate the hierarchy of the tree, it is sometimes not
clear depending on the frame thickness and child density. Because colors are
more salient, we decided to implement a highlighting system that colors the
rectangle that the mouse is on, as well as all its ancestors in a gradient.
